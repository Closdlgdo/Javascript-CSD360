       <p> Batman vs. Bane Fight Scene </p>

       <p> BANE: Peace has cost you your strength, <span id = "victory"> _________ </span> has defeated you. </p>

       <p> BANE: Theatricality and deception; powerful agents to the uninitiated... but we are initiated, aren't we Bruce? Members of the <span id = "League of Shadows">
        ______________________ </span>! And you betrayed us! </p>

       <p>
        BATMAN: Yes, you were <span id = "excommunicated"> _________ </span> by a gang of psychopaths.
       </p>
       <p>
        BANE: I am the League of Shadows! I'm here to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's <span id = "destiny">_______</span>!        
       </p>
       <p>
        BANE: You fight like a <span id = "younger man"> _________ </span>, with nothing held back. Admirable but mistaken.
       </p>

        *Batman uses his EMP on his utility belt to cut the lights*
        <p>
        BANE: Ahhh you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark. <span id = "I was born in it, molded by it.">____________</span> I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding!
        </p>

        *Bane grabs Batman out of the shadows*
        <p>
        BANE: The shadows betray you because <span id = "they belong to me!">_________</span>
        </p>
        *Bane punches a defeated Batman on his mask repeatedly*
        <p>
        <span id = "BANE: I will show where Ive made my home whilst preparing to bring justice. Then Ill break you.">_____________</span>
       </p>
